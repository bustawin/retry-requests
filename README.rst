Retry-requests
##############
Configures the passed-in `requests' <http://python-requests.org>`_ ``Session``
to retry on failed requests due to connection errors, timeouts,
specific HTTP response codes (5XX by default) and 30X redirections
â€”anything that could fail.

Python 3.6+.

Basic usage:

.. code-block:: python

  from retry_requests import retry
  my_session = retry()
  my_session.get("http://foo.bar")

Using your session and configurations:

.. code-block:: python

  from retry_requests import retry
  from requests import Session
  my_session = retry(Session(), retries=5, backoff_factor=0.2)
  my_session.get('https://foo.bar')

Note that you have a ``TSession``, a ``Session`` with a default timeout,
and ``RSession``, a ``Session`` with a timeout that always ``raise_for_status()``,
for your convenience.
